        <abbr title="show tooltip">HTML</abbr>element are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, image and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded
        into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantic for text such as <em><b> headings,
        Paragraphs,lists,links,quates,and other items.</b></em>
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using <u>angle bracket</u>. Tags such as <font color="green
        "> &lt;img/&gt; and &lt;input/&gt;</font> directly introduce content into the page.
        Other tags such as <font color="green"> &lt;p &gt;</font> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
        Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
